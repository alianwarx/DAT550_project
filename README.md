This code uses the english sentence as input dataset and with use of an embeding layer first a representation
the input dataset is presented. Then, a LSTM and a CNN model is trained to classify relation between sentences in
3 categories. Result of the evaluation shows a slightly better result with CNN.

This code is using PCA for visualization. In this code three machine learning model (RF, KNN, AdaBosst) are used 
for classification of encoded input. Evaluation results showed superiority of RF.
